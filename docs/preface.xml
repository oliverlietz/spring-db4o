  comments, please post them on the user mailing list or on the Spring Modules

  <para> Before we go on, a few words of gratitude: Chris Bauer (of the
  Hibernate team) prepared and adapted the DocBook-XSL software in order to be
  able to create Hibernate's reference guide, also allowing us to create this
  one. </para>
