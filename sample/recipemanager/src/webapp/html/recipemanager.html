	<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Spring Db4o Recipe Manager Application</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>

	<p> Spring Db4o is an add-on library to Spring in order to support the object database Db4o.
		This includes translation of Db4o specific exceptions to Spring's unchecked
		DataAccessException hierarchy, a template-like class for interaction with the
		database, a transaction manager and the possibility to configure db4o within your
		Spring application-context.xml file. </p>
	
<br>
<h2>Recipe Manager Sample Application Requirements</h2>
The sample application supports the following:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Use Cases:</span><br>
<ul>
  <li>Create a new recipe (that's actually only its title)</li>
  <li>View a list of available recipes</li>
</ul>
	
<h2>RecipeManager Sample Application Design</h2>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Server
Technology</span><br>
The sample application should be usable with any J2EE web application
container that is compatible with the Servet 2.3 and JSP 1.2
specifications. The view technologies that are to be used for rendering 
the application are Java Server Pages (JSP) along with the 
Java Standard Tag Library (JSTL).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Database
Technology</span><br>
The sample application uses the object-oriented database management
system <a href="http://www.db4o.com">db4o</a> for data storage.
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Development
Environment</span><br>
A copy of all necessary jar files is provided with the
sample application. The developer will need to obtain the following 
tools externally, all of
which are freely available:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Java SDK 1.4.x</li>
  <li>Ant 1.6.x</li>
  <li>Tomcat 5.5.x, or some other web application container</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">NOTE:</span> The version numbers
listed are those that were used in the development of the RecipeManager
application. Other versions of the same tools may or may not work.<br>
